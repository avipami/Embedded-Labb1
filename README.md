# Embedded-Labb1
<h2>Nackademin Embedded Course</h2>

Lab1 of the embedded course, using atmega328 and bitoperations to control pins that are attached to leds through uart commands.
Main purpuse is to not shit your pants in the future when bumping into register names and bitshifting.

The makefile is streamlined for easier understanding on the steps and processes it does for compiling.

By using make in the terminal when working from the folder it compiles and uploads to the port it is coded to.
